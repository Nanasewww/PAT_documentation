# Tag

## Definition

T[ag system](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is essential to PAT. <mark style="color:orange;">**Action Stateâ€™s transition logic is defined by Tags, which creates a dynamic state machine system.**</mark> Beyond that, some other components also use Tags for communication purposes. For example, you can make a character invincible by granting it invincible Tag and [Hurtbox ](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]will react to it.

## Tag Container

At run time, Character will <mark style="color:orange;">**automatically add a Tag Container Component**</mark> to itself, which stores all the Tags that a character is currently holding and is updated each frame. It is a very helpful tool for debugging if Tags were successfully granted.
