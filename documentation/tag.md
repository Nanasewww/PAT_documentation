# Tag

## Definition

T[ag system](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is essential to PAT. <mark style="color:orange;">**Action Stateâ€™s transition logic is defined by Tags, which creates a dynamic state machine system.**</mark> Beyond that, some other components also use Tags for communication purposes. For example, you can make a character invincible by granting it invincible Tag and Hurtbox will react to it.

All tags are stored inside a script named **GamePlayTag**, you may edit it on your own need. It is a huge enum. Every Tag is represented by a name and a number.&#x20;

Tags are toggled on the Action State component.
