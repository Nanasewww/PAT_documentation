# Player

Player class is the connection between real world player and in-game character

You can define the relationship between physical input and tags that are sent to character

Real camera of the game is assigned to Player instance, and virtual cameras can be nested in for player-controlled camera behavior

Plus, local-multiplayer is possible by setting up multiple Player instance and connect with Unity's native muti-player solution.&#x20;
