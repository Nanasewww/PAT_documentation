# Task 3: Cost mana

By right-clicking, PlayerRabbit can perform a ranged attack. This powerful, long-distance attack doesnâ€™t require the player to approach enemies. To balance its strength, we can add mana consumption to limit its usage.

UseAttributeMod is a Modifier that can send a value change Effect to a character's Attribute. The Resource Tag specifies the target of the modification, while the Amount determines the value used.&#x20;

An Attribute is a MonoBehaviour that holds a value. Health, Posture, Mana, and Stamina are all examples of Attributes. Since Attributes can be influenced by Effects in an easy and stable way without tightly coupling your code, we encourage you to use Attributes for many other values you want to change dynamically during gameplay. For more details on Attributes and Effects, please refer to our documentation.
