# Action State & Modifier

Action State and State Modifier are two key concepts in PAT, but their usage isn't always clear from definitions alone. In this section, you will learn through hands-on practice, using Modifiers to easily adjust the behavior of an Action State.

In the Tutorial Scene, you can find a Character named PlayerRabbit. In the following steps, youâ€™ll use Modifiers to tweak this character's Action States to make some new abilities.
