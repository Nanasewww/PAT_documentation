# Apply Effects

If a character wants to add effect to itself, you should probably use Add Effect Mod.\


If a character wants to add effect to other PAT components, you may use Attack With Hitbox Mod or Add Effect On Hit Mod. Or you can use the Add Effect Box, which needs to be attached to a trigger so that it allows designs like traps.



When choosing which Effects to apply, you can drag all the Scriptable Objects you created into the effect lists, or you can find an option called Effect Factory on scripts like Attack With Hitbox Mod. \


**Effect Factory**

Effect Factory is a composited effect for you to create multiple effects at once. We provide you a template called EffectFactory and a damage factory EffectFactory\_P applied that template. You may write factories for your own convenience.\
