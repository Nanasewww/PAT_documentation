# Step 3: Character - Action States

## Find Action State Melee 1

TODOFind MoveSet

TODOOpen Moveset Prefab

TODOFind Melee 1

What matters in this Step is the Action State Script.&#x20;

An <mark style="color:orange;">**Action State**</mark> is the minimal state that describes a characterâ€™s action. It includes locomotion actions like moving, jumping, dashing, or any combat action like swinging a sword or firing a gun. It is the basic unit that adds up to the entirety of our action system in PAT. <mark style="color:orange;">Action State by itself has very limited functionality</mark>, it serves as a logic system that shows which state a character is in (what it is doing), and what it can do from the current state. Most _real_ functionalities are fulfilled by <mark style="color:orange;">State Modifiers</mark> that are add on to Action States, and we will cover that later.

## Input Tag

So how do inputs from players get transmitted to the characters? If you recall what we mentioned in the last article _Step 2: A Basic Scene_, the Player Script handles your inputs. Each input unit bounds an action reference from the Input Action System to an Input Tag (which is the Tag field shown below)

For example, if you input the Attack button, the Player will try to send a Light Attack Tag to the Character, and Character will find if it matches the Action State's Input Tag.

You can find what State the Character is in by going to the Character Object. It is on the Character Script.
