# Step 3: Character - Action States

## Goal

Understanding what Action State is, finding Tag Container, and how Action States are connected to Input Tags

***

## Find SwordMoveset

Click onto _MyFirstCharacter_, you can find _SwordMoveset_ inside Element 0 of Stack Move Sets. Open the prefab.

Click onto Attack1.

What matters in this step is the Action State Script.&#x20;

An <mark style="color:orange;">**Action State**</mark> is the minimal state that describes a characterâ€™s action. Action States include locomotion actions like moving, jumping, dashing, or combat actions like swinging a sword or firing a gun. It is the basic unit that adds up to the entirety of our action system in PAT. <mark style="color:orange;">Action State by itself has very limited functionality</mark>, it serves as a logic system (or State Machine, if you prefer) that shows which state a character is in (what it is doing), and what it can do from the current state. Most _real_ functionalities are fulfilled by <mark style="color:orange;">State Modifiers</mark> that are add on to Action States, and we will cover those later.

So how does an Action State know when it should be triggered? What allows the knight to attack after a left click?

## Input Unit

If you recall what we mentioned at the end of [_Step 2: Tutorial Scene_](step-2-tutorial-scene.md#play-mode), the Player Component handles your inputs. Each input unit bounds an action reference from the Input Action System to an Input Tag.

For example, if you input the Attack button (left clicking your mouse / west button on controller), the Player will send a Light Attack Tag to the Character, and Character will find if it matches the Action State's Input Tag.

***

## Tag Container

For you to check what tags were sent to a character, we have a component called Tag Container generated by Character component. In this tutorial, it is on MyFirstCharacter. Note that it is only added to the object at runtime, so you have to start the game first to find it in the inspector.

## Input Tag

On each Update, all Action States will try to grab Input Tag from the Tag Container. If they found the matching Input Tag, the Action State will try to be triggered -- However, this doesn't mean they can always be triggered with the Input Tag, there are more restrictions that will be explained in the next Step.

This is how the knight attacks -- It receives an Input Tag from the Player. Now let's try do the same thing for another Action State.
